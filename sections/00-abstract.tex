\begin{abstract}

Selecting the most effective tools and languages for teaching parallel and
distributed computing presents a challenge for teachers and students. Often a
high-level solution seems easier, but it comes with the cost of hiding
underlying concepts and problems. In this paper we present a comparison between
the \textit{Pthreads} and \textit{OpenMP} APIs considering the experiences and
performance results of undergraduate and graduate Computer Science students.
We show that students were able to achieve better performance results using
\textit{Pthreads} than \textit{OpenMP}, despite their perception that
\textit{Pthreads} is harder to learn and use.
